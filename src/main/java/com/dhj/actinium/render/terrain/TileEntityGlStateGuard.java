 * Saves and restores the full GLSM-tracked GL state around tile-entity (TESR) batches.

 * <p>Vanilla relies on tile-entity renderers leaving GL state as they found it, but modded
 * TESRs (notably HBM-CE machines) leak depth mask/func, blend and texture state. Actinium
 * renders block entities as a dedicated stage inside the chunk render pass with no state
 * normalization afterward, so a leak lands directly in the translucent terrain pass and the
 * HUD. GLSM already maintains a complete tracked-state stack
 * ({@link GLStateManager#glPushAttrib(int)}); this guard simply wires it into the TESR path.
 * Matrices are not covered here (push/pop attrib semantics) — the vanilla dispatcher already
 * wraps each tile entity in its own matrix push/pop.</p>
