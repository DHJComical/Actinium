/**
 * Stateless deterministic 2D value noise applied to biome-tinted block colors (issue #56,
 * modeled after Ambient Environment with three deliberate corrections):
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Applied after blending.</b> Ambient Environment injects the noise inside the biome
 *       blend loop, so the blend average cancels most of the per-position variation out (the larger
 *       the blend radius, the weaker the effect). Every injection point here applies the noise to
 *       the final blended color, keyed to the block's own position — never to the blend sample
 *       positions.</li>
 *   <li><b>Bidirectional offsets.</b> Ambient Environment only mixes towards black, which darkens
 *       the mean color. The scale factor here is multiplicative {@code 1 +/- intensity}, so the
 *       noisy color stays centered on the blended mean and only varies around it.</li>
 *   <li><b>Smooth curve.</b> The fade uses the quintic smoothstep {@code 6t^5 - 15t^4 + 10t^3}
 *       instead of tangent-shaped curves with poles, so neighboring blocks never show a hard seam
 *       regardless of how the corner values happen to fall.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The noise itself is classic 2D value noise: integer lattice points are hashed to
 * pseudo-random values in [0, 1) with a splitmix64-style integer mixer (allocation free and
 * purely functional, so chunk build threads and the main thread can sample concurrently without
 * any shared mutable state), and the four corners of the enclosing cell are bilinearly
 * interpolated. Two octaves are summed — the second at double frequency, weighted roughly 2:1
 * (0.65 / 0.35) — and the result is remapped from [0, 1] to [-1, 1] so callers can scale around
 * the mean color symmetrically.</p>
